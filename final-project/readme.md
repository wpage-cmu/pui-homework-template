# FP1 - Proposal for Critique

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

People make decisions everyday, but often do not have the best information to make them. We have all at the end of the month realized that we have overspent, whether it be on food, clothes, or some other budget category. This project's goal is to notify the user of the remaining budget in the relevant category when they enter a location or website of interest.

### *Idea 2*

Similar to project 1, this project informs users of their remaining caloric budget in locations or websites of interest. The nuance here though is that it will sit on top of an activity recognition algorithm I am building in a different class in order to recognize eating. This would use that to prompt users to input their calories, and computer vision (likely Google Lens) to recognize the food and assist in calorie estimation.

### *Idea 3*

Finally, this is a straightforward personal website, primarily aimed at Sr. Product Manager or Research Engineer roles.

## Feedback Summary
The two main pieces of feedback I got were relevant to project 1 and 2. The first piece of feedback was from my TA and very valid, specifically for project 2: Have a backup plan in case the activity recognition project does not work out. The second piece of feedback was regarding goal entry. Specifically, the group was curious if part of these projects would be to help people identify their goals. I will be taking a naive approach to this project, meaning that I assume people already know their goals and can enter them into the provided UI.
