# FP1 - Proposal for Critique

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

People make decisions everyday, but often do not have the best information to make them. We have all at the end of the month realized that we have overspent, whether it be on food, clothes, or some other budget category. This project's goal is to notify the user of the remaining budget in the relevant category when they enter a location or website of interest.

### *Idea 2*

Similar to project 1, this project informs users of their remaining caloric budget in locations or websites of interest. The nuance here though is that it will sit on top of an activity recognition algorithm I am building in a different class in order to recognize eating. This would use that to prompt users to input their calories, and computer vision (likely Google Lens) to recognize the food and assist in calorie estimation.

### *Idea 3*

Finally, this is a straightforward personal website, primarily aimed at Sr. Product Manager or Research Engineer roles.
